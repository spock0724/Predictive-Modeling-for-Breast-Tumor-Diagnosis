# Predictive-Modeling-for-Breast-Tumor-Diagnosis
This project analyzes breast tumor data to identify patterns and make predictions about tumor types. KNN and Logiistic Regression Models are compared for accuracy.
## Data: 
   - The dataset is provided in the 'cancer.csv' file, contains information about breast tumor characteristics.
## Dependencies:
- numpy: numerical computing, array operations.
- pandas: data loading and manipulation.
- matplotlib: data visualization.
- scikit-learn: machine learning model training/evaluation.
